# UAV_Control
UC Berkeley ME 136 Intro to UAV Control Final Project Code

Code is run on a class-modded version of PX4 Autopilot, jMAVSim simulator. Equipment used is C++ on Eclipse in an Ubuntu VirtualBox.

This is a semester long group project, so all work in source_initial is my own work while source_final is collaborated work between 3 members. Credits for the group work cannot be taken as mine alone. The last objective that our quadcopter achieves is being able to hover at a minimum height of 1.5m and land softly at a location (1,0,0)m in space after a designated input of certain buttons.
